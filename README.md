#### Github cheatsheet

1. Always `git pull` before beginning to work! This makes sure your version is compatible with what other have worked on since you were last coding.
2. `git commit` early and often! Check status using `git status` -- have you made changes? 
3. Once you've made all your changes, `git push` to update the remote version.
4. Best practices can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/pandeiro/1552496).
